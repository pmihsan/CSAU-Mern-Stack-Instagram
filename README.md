# CSAU-MERN-STACK-INSTAGRAM

An Instagram-inspired CRUD application which allows users to add, modify, update and delete posts. The users can post text or image description and other users can see the realtime updates.

This system has been containerized with the help of docker. You can also build the same using the docker compose file, but before that update your client side code with your corresponding <b>MACHINE_IP</b> in the <b>constants.js</b> file. Similarly add the same in the .env of your server side. Then you are good to go.

Clone this repo and use
```
    docker compose up
```

It starts building the containers and runs them, once complete you can access it in your browser using <b>http://localhost:3000</b> or <b>http://MACHINE_IP:3000</b>
